Way to learn:

to run the code, the 'data_test.csv', 'data_train.csv', and 's1234567_predictions.csv' are required. When the final step is began,
the code will read the 's1234567_predictions.csv'  and create the 'COSC2753_A1_Predictions_s3740878.csv' file.
 
Brief introduction of the code: 

The provided code includes the basic steps to develop the three machine learning models which are the Polynomial
logistic regression, multivatriate logistic regression, and Decision tree. Each model developed with showing default model,
and after adjusting hyperparameter models. After implementing the model, the model was evaluated with confusion matrix,
and classification report. When the best model is founded, it utilize to predict the dataset in the test dataset. Finally, the
values of the predicted feature ('Status') are filled into the 's3740878_predictions.csv'. The way to fill the target feature is that
read s1234567_predictions.csv, and put the predicted value into a constant variable, and save the csv file.

Problem:

Eventhough I did not change the file form, when I put the csv file to the jupyter notebook then download that csv file to
my local computer, the csv file form is changed to the xls file. I cannot fix the problem and I took a video for this situation,
and I attached it.
